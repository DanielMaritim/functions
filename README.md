And how does one define a function? well A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Why are functions important?

 Functions are the fundamental building blocks for reusable code. Once a function is defined, it can be used over and over and over again
 
 The advantages of using functions are:

    Avoid repetition of codes.
    Increases program readability.
    Divide a complex problem into simpler ones.
    Reduces chances of error.
    Modifying a program becomes easier by using function.
    
    There can be 4 different types of user-defined functions, they are:

    Function with no arguments and no return value.
    Function with no arguments and a return value.
    Function with arguments and no return value.

    Most importantly is to understand how to write a function.
    
    If you get to know this then learning them becomes easy.
    
    Steps to Writing a Function

    Understand the purpose of the function.
    
    Define the data that comes into the function from the caller (in the form of parameters)!
    Define what data variables are needed inside the function to accomplish its goal.
    Decide on the set of steps that the program will use to accomplish this goal.
